Deep learning is a subset of machine learning powered by multilayered artificial neural networks that mimic the human brain to process data and recognize complex patterns. It powers advanced technologies like computer vision, speech recognition, and generative AI.How Deep Learning WorksNeural Networks: Built using layers of connected artificial nodes or "neurons".Layers: Consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers (the "deep" part), and an output layer.Feature Learning: Automatically extracts features from raw, unstructured data without manual help.Training: Adjusts internal weights and learns from mistakes over time using massive datasets
